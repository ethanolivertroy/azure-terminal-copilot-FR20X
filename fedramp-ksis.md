## Summary

FedRAMP’s 20x Phase One Key Security Indicators creates an abstraction layer to summarize the security capabilities expected of a cloud-native service offering to meet FedRAMP Low authorization requirements. These indicators align to NIST SP 800-53 controls and form a baseline equivalent.

These Key Security Indicators will be updated after public comment and formalized for use in the FedRAMP 20x Phase One Pilot to grant FedRAMP Low authorizations. During Phase Two, Key Security Indicators will be expanded for FedRAMP Moderate authorizations.

Authorization packages based on Key Security Indicators must be machine-readable, supported by evidence, and should include automated technical validation whenever possible.

## Motivation and Rationale

FedRAMP 20x describes key goals for a new assessment approach that is being designed by FedRAMP in collaboration with industry stakeholders and agency experts. Automation efforts have historically focused on automating the production of documentation materials to be used in an assessment, but the FedRAMP Authorization Act requires FedRAMP to establish a means for the “automation of security assessments and reviews.” FedRAMP asserts that automatically producing and reviewing documentation alone will not meet this requirement.

FedRAMP 20x encourages the development of truly automated security assessment with continuous validation and enforcement by following NIST guidance to focus on required security capabilities. This initial release will serve as a foundation for the FedRAMP 20x pilot program, allowing us to refine the approach based on real-world implementation before expanding to additional service types and impact levels.

## Explanation

The full draft standard is approximately 5 pages and is available for review in the following formats:

- Basic web formatting on fedramp.gov (below)

The FedRAMP Automating Assessments Working Group will simultaneously host discussions on potential best practices and implementation methods for integration of Key Security Indicators into the FedRAMP 20x Phase One Pilot for FedRAMP Low authorizations.

## Background

> [OMB Circular A-130: Managing Information as a Strategic Resource](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf) Appendix I states *“Agencies may also develop overlays for specific types of information or communities of interest (e.g., all web-based applications, all health care-related systems) as part of the security control selection process. Overlays provide a specification of security or privacy controls, control enhancements, supplemental guidance, and other supporting information as part of the tailoring process, that is intended to complement (and further refine) security control baselines. The overlay may be more stringent or less stringent than the original security control baseline and can be applied to multiple information systems.”*

> [NIST SP 800-53B: Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/b/upd1/final) Section 2.5 states *“As the number of controls in \[SP 800-53\] grows in response to an increasingly sophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key capabilities needed to protect organizational missions and business functions, and to subsequently select controls that—if properly designed, developed, and implemented—produce such capabilities. The use of capabilities simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. Using the construct of a capability provides a method of grouping controls that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective.”*
> 
> This section later states *“Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the degree to which the desired capabilities have been effectively achieved.”*

> [NIST SP 800-53A*:* Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/a/r5/final) Section 3.5 states “ *When organizations employ the concept of capabilities, automated and manual assessments account for all security and privacy controls that comprise the security and privacy capabilities. Assessors are aware of how the controls work together to provide such capabilities.”*

> [The FedRAMP Authorization Act (44 USC § 3609 (a) (1))](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2023-title44/USCODE-2023-title44-chap36-sec3609) requires that the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall *“in consultation with the \[DHS\] Secretary, develop, coordinate, and implement a process to support agency review, reuse, and standardization, where appropriate, of security assessments of cloud computing products and services…”* 44 USC § 3609 (c) (2) further states that *“the \[GSA\] Administrator shall establish a means for the automation of security assessments and reviews.”* These responsibilities are .

## Introduction

Modern cloud services often use automated or code-driven configuration management and control planes to ensure predictable, repeatable, reliable, and secure outcomes during deployment and operation.

Consequently, FedRAMP asserts that the majority of a service security assessment can take place continuously via automated validation for simple cloud-native services if the need for a traditional control-by-control narrative approach is removed.

The [FedRAMP 20x Phase One Pilot](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-one/) will test this assertion for a subset of low impact systems by granting conditional FedRAMP Low authorization to services that meet the full Phase One eligibility requirements and qualifications. To qualify for this authorization, cloud services must at minimum provide a machine readable package that demonstrates a continuous, automated validation approach for a significant portion of the FedRAMP Key Security Indicators (KSIs) outlined in this standard.

The resulting packages and validation approaches will inform Phase Two and other formal standards for FedRAMP 20x. Services that receive FedRAMP 20x Low authorizations during Phase One will be prioritized for the FedRAMP 20x Moderate pilot in Phase Two.

## Key Security Indicators

FedRAMP Key Security Indicators summarize the capabilities that satisfy FedRAMP security requirements aligned to NIST SP 800-53 controls, providing an abstraction layer that is simpler to approach and assess. Each Key Security Indicator includes critical security capabilities that must be met and validated. These capabilities are designed to provide a concrete approach to evaluating cloud security risks that can often be automatically derived from technical configurations and resolved to true or false.

Key Security Indicators are engineered to address critical limitations in existing security assessment approaches:

- Simplified capabilities: Reduce lengthy and complex security compliance to clear, actionable, capability-based standards
- Automation-Friendly: Eliminate reliance on narrative to create a foundation for future automated security assessment processes
- Flexible Implementation: Enable private innovation to design different methods for validation

Although Key Security Indicators are designed to produce final validations that are true or false, the minimum expectations for validation and assessment will require cloud service providers and third party assessment organizations to provide reasonable evidence supporting the final validation.

To maximize innovation, this standard does not propose validation, evidence, or assessment expectations for Key Security Indicators. Instead, minimum expectations for validation, evidence, and assessment will be determined during active FedRAMP 20x pilots in collaboration with cloud service providers, third party assessment organizations, and federal agencies.

All FedRAMP 20x packages submitted for assessment based on these standards must be in a machine-readable format that can be regenerated on demand.
